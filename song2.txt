You were walking on the moon
Now you feeling low-ow-ow
What they said wasn't true
You're beautiful
Sticks and stones break your bones
I know what you're feeling
Words like those
Won't steal your glow
You're one in a million, this, this is for all the girls
Boys all over the world
Whatever you been told
You're worth more than gold
So hold your head up high
It's your time to shine
From the inside out it shows
You're worth more than gold
You're worth more than gold
